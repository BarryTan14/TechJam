## Example Analysis

### Feature: User Data Analytics Dashboard

**Score**: 0.35 (Moderately Sensitive)

**Reasoning**: 
"This feature raises significant privacy concerns for US users. The collection of personal browsing history, location data, and demographic information without clear consent mechanisms violates US privacy expectations and may conflict with state regulations like CCPA. The lack of data export and deletion capabilities further compounds privacy concerns."

**Cultural Factors Considered**:
- Privacy and data handling
- Individual privacy rights
- State regulations (CCPA, CPRA)
- Federal regulations

**Potential Issues**:
- May not provide adequate user consent mechanisms
- Violates US privacy expectations
- May conflict with state privacy regulations
- No data export/deletion capabilities

**Recommendations**:
- Implement clear consent mechanisms and opt-out options
- Add data export and deletion capabilities
- Ensure compliance with state privacy regulations
- Provide transparency about data collection and usage
- Conduct privacy impact assessment

## Integration with Workflow

The US cultural sensitivity analysis is integrated into the main workflow:

1. **Feature Analysis**: Each feature is analyzed for US cultural sensitivity
2. **Aggregation**: Results are aggregated across all features
3. **Overall Assessment**: Provides overall cultural sensitivity score and recommendations
4. **Storage**: Results are stored in MongoDB for future reference
5. **Reporting**: Included in executive reports and API responses

## Usage

    feature_content="Detailed feature content"
)

print(f"Score: {analysis.overall_score:.2f} ({analysis.score_level})")
print(f"Reasoning: {analysis.reasoning}")
print(f"Recommendations: {analysis.recommendations}")
```
