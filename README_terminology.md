# Terminology Insertion Script

This script inserts terminology terms into a MongoDB collection for the TechJam project.

## Prerequisites

1. **MongoDB Installation**: Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your system
2. **Python Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_mongodb.txt
```

## Configuration

1. **Edit MongoDB Configuration**: Update the `mongodb_config.py` file with your MongoDB connection details:

```python
# For local MongoDB
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"

# For MongoDB with authentication
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/"

# For MongoDB Atlas
MONGO_URI = "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/"

# Database and collection names
DATABASE_NAME = "techjam"
COLLECTION_NAME = "terminology"
```

## Usage

Run the script to insert all terminology terms:

```bash
python insert_terminology.py
```

## What the Script Does

1. **Connects to MongoDB** using the configured connection string
2. **Creates the collection** if it doesn't exist
3. **Clears existing data** (optional - can be commented out)
4. **Inserts 20 terminology terms** with their descriptions
5. **Displays the results** showing all inserted terms
6. **Shows collection statistics**

## Terminology Terms Included

The script inserts the following terms:

- **NR**: Not recommended
- **PF**: Personalized feed
- **GH**: Geo-handler; a module responsible for routing features based on user region
- **CDS**: Compliance Detection System
- **DRT**: Data retention threshold; duration for which logs can be stored
- **LCP**: Local compliance policy
- **Redline**: Flag for legal review (different from its traditional business use for 'financial loss')
- **Softblock**: A user-level limitation applied silently without notifications
- **Spanner**: A synthetic name for a rule engine (not to be confused with Google Spanner)
- **ShadowMode**: Deploy feature in non-user-impact way to collect analytics only
- **T5**: Tier 5 sensitivity data; more critical than T1‚ÄìT4 in this internal taxonomy
- **ASL**: Age-sensitive logic
- **Glow**: A compliance-flagging status, internally used to indicate geo-based alerts
- **NSP**: Non-shareable policy (content should not be shared externally)
- **Jellybean**: Feature name for internal parental control system
- **EchoTrace**: Log tracing mode to verify compliance routing
- **BB**: Baseline Behavior; standard user behavior used for anomaly detection
- **Snowcap**: A synthetic codename for the child safety policy framework
- **FR**: Feature rollout status
- **IMT**: Internal monitoring trigger

## Database Schema

Each document in the collection has the following structure:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),  // MongoDB auto-generated ID
  "term": "NR",            // The terminology abbreviation
  "description": "Not recommended"  // The full description
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Make sure MongoDB is running
- Check the connection string in `mongodb_config.py`
- Verify network connectivity if using remote MongoDB

### Permission Issues
- Ensure the MongoDB user has write permissions to the database
- Check if authentication is required and credentials are correct

### Collection Already Exists
- The script will clear existing data by default
- Comment out the `collection.delete_many({})` line if you want to keep existing data
